            The all new /co/ series <i>Blimbo and His Friend</i>
            (previously <i>The Fagtitiously Retarded Fagntics of Blimbo and His Friend</i><ref post="143980417, 144009762">) 
            follows the misadventures of the titular Blimbo and His Friend as they team-up with random, often dysfunctional, collaborators
            to attempt to produce a successful comic/cartoon<ref post="143977698, 143977790, 143986839 ">, all the while navigating the day-to-day
            encounters with their eccentric roommate couple Doodle and Glimbo as well as the absurd world they find themselves in. The show 
            satirizes many of the typical tropes of animated television along with many of the prevalent archetypes 
            inhabiting/orbiting its industry<ref post="143980760"/>, primarily those of interest/notoriety to /co/.
        </p>
        <p>
            The series is set in an over-industrialised metropolis, VilleVille<ref post="144065292">, made up of physically impossible haphazard 
            architecture<ref post="143987561"> and inhabited by an equally chaotic random assortment of unique creatures. This eclectic population of cartoon characters both
            represents and features the various mindsets and stylings, respectively, ubiquitous to /co/ and the broader cartoon community the show is satirizing, 
            a few of which will cross paths and collaborate with Blimbo<ref post="143990392 ">. The majority of the city's citizens, including our main cast, reside in
            a near infinitely tall and wide apartment complex, the <i>Happy Day Tower</i><ref post="144069576"> (previously the <i>Babel Tower 8</i><ref post="144069425">), 
            that spralls from every end of the city, weaving between businesses, resturants and parks, to meet at a centrals mother building<ref post="144069078">.
            The building is collectively owned by a triopoly of omnipotent competing entertainment conglomerates,
            The Fun James Sea Company, The Happy Robert Mountain company and The Good Michael Sun Company<ref post="144069897, 144070059">, 
            who each engage in never-ending back and forth trade of segments of the complex amongst one another to further each's own convoluted plot to nickle and dime their way 
            to soul ownership<ref post="144070001">.

                        Blimbo is the neurotic and creative protagonist of <i>Blimbo and His Friend</i>.<ref post="143980908 ">. She is an aspiring cartoonist<ref post="144057003">, 
                        but regularly finds herself wildly off track from achieving her goals due to her impatient and erratic nature<ref post="143977113 ">, 
                        acting partially as a surrogate for her passionate but largely unproductive board of origin /co/ <ref post="144057473 ">. At her best,
                        she is adventurous, resourceful and motivated when engrossed in one of her and His Friend's artistic
                        endevours, but often that same productive driving force leads her awry
                        once the novelty of a project wares off or a self destructive impulse tempts her. 
                        Her generally impetuous personality severely undermines any interpersonal skills she might possess, as
                        she can't help but blurt out exactly what's on her mind or what would be most immediately satisfying
                        to tell someone. 
                        <br><br>
                        A contributor to these personality faults is Blimbo's deep-seated insecurity surrounding her femininity. 
                        Despite being in her early 20s, Blimbo's physical appearance most resembles a pudgy child, with boyish
                        hippo-like features decorating her bulbous face. These feelings of inadequacy are intensified by the consistent presence
                        of an eerily similar looking but far further physically developed woman dating her
