            The all new /co/ series <i>Blimbo and His Friend</i>
            (previously <i>The Fagtitiously Retarded Fagntics of Blimbo and His Friend</i><ref post="143980417, 144009762">) 
            follows the misadventures of the titular Blimbo and His Friend as they team-up with random, often dysfunctional, collaborators
            to attempt to pitch a successful comic/cartoon<ref post="143977698, 143977790">, all the while navigating the day-to-day
            encounters with their eccentric roommate couple Doodle and Glimbo as well as the absurd world they find themselves in. The show 
            satirizes many of the typical tropes of animated television along with prominent archetypes 
            inhabiting/orbiting its industry<ref post="143980760"/>, primarily those of notoriety to /co/.
        </p>
        <p>
            The series is set in an over-industrialised metropolis made up of physically impossible haphazard 
            architecture<ref post="143987561"> and inhabited by an equally chaotic assortment of every possible type of creature. This eclectic population of cartoon characters both
            represents and features the various mindsets and stylings of /co/ and the broader cartoon community, 
            a few of which will be focused on when they cross paths and try to make a comic/cartoon with the main cast<ref post="143990392 ">.

        <dropset title="Cup of Sugar">
            <p>One day Blimbo went to HisFriendLand to ask His Friend for a cup of sugar, but His Friend could not give him a cup of sugar, for the Ants had already borrowed the sugar. So Blimbo and His Friend went to see the Ants. The two went to AntLand to ask the Ants if they could have their cup of sugar back. But the Ants needed the sugar for their Sunday Pie, and they had run out before they could finish it. However, they knew a Baker that knew how to make sugar. So Blimbo, His Friend, and the Ants went to see the Baker. The three went to BakerLand to ask the Baker if he could make the Ants enough sugar for their Sunday Pie, so His Friend can give Blimbo a cup of sugar. But the Baker forgot the recipe, and only the Baker's Brain remembered. So Blimbo, His Friend, the Ants, and the Baker all went to see the Baker's Brain. The four went to Baker'sBrainLand to ask the Baker's Brain if he could help the Baker remember the recipe for sugar, so the Baker could make the Ants their Sunday Pie, so His Friend could give Blimbo a cup of sugar. But thinking about it gave the Baker's Brain a brain freeze, and he needed a nice, woolly hat to keep his mind warm and pure. Unfortunately for the Barker's Brain, the Baker, the Ants, and His Friend, Blimbo was rather exhausted by this point. "I've travelled Next Door, through the Big Anthill, over the Baker's Dozen, and into the Day Dreams. I think I'd rather have a salad instead." And so Blimbo, His Friend, the Ants, the Baker, and the Baker's Brain all enjoyed a nice leafy treat under the warm, inviting rays of the sun. The End.<ref post="143976055"></p>
