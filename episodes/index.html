    <h2>Blimbo and His Friend Episodes</h2>
    <h4><a href="../">&lt;&lt; Back</a></h4>
    <p><a>Some notable animations and comics created for the project thus far. 
        Not exactly definitive "episodes", so to speak, but proof-of-concept shorts to get a feel for the series' direction, 
        highlight the talent on offer, and hopefully attract more contributors.</a>

                    The first animation done for the series, with the audio and visuals being produced by
                    a single anon<ref post="143982165"> using Flash CS6<ref post="144077287 ">. Only a couple of seconds were coompleted due to time restrictions<ref post="143982348 "> 
                    but the full cartoon was intended to be based on the first suggestion for an episode<ref post="143975501"> and early side-character 
                    Mr. Senior<ref post="144077287, 143978074">

                This short was created off the back of a quick 2 frame gif of Doodle showcasing his unique brand of affection 
                to Blimbo's dismay<ref post="143989054 ">. Using the subsequently shared flash file of the gif<ref post="143990708">, another anon wrote a short
                script, requested voice lines and manipulated and added drawings to the provided assets to create this longer animation<ref post="143991198 ">.
                2 days after the original gif, the cartoon was completed<ref post="144017322 ">, though, the creator was unable to export the animation
                properly, likely due to the differing versions of Adobe Flash/Animate being used, so another anon edited the animation a bit and 
                rexporteted it<ref post="144022900 ">, which is the version embeded here.
                Interestingly, the voice for Blimbo in this was also alledgedly the anon who made the first short<ref post="144077648 ">.
